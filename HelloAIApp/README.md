# HelloAIApp

This sample SwiftUI project now demonstrates a simple login screen and a main interface similar to a dating app.

## Running the app

1. Open Xcode and choose **File > Open**.
2. Navigate to this folder and select the project.
3. Build and run on the simulator or a connected iOS device.

After launching, you'll see a login form styled with Apple's frosted glass effect. Once logged in, the main screen presents a feed of task messages with green **Accept** and red **Reject** buttons at the bottom.
